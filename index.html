        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Liam Simmons, and I've been a part of Power for nearly 3 years, where I've held various titles including customer development representative, sales representative, and project production manager. Now, I'm eagerly pursuing my next title as a student developer. During my first year at Power, I balanced full-time college studies while contributing to the company. I'm a lifelong learner with a passion for acquiring new skills and knowledge. Outside of work and studies, I enjoy spending time with my beloved dog Daisy and caring for my beta fish named Skippy. Additionally, I have a keen interest in scuba diving, fishkeeping, motorcycle riding, boxing, and weightlifting, which are my favorite hobbies. Please enjoy browsing my first website to learn more about me!

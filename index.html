      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy traveling to different parts of the world for scuba diving adventures. Riding my motorcycle allows me to experience the thrill of the open road and connect with nature. Fishkeeping is another hobby of mine, and I find joy in caring for aquatic creatures. Additionally, boxing has become a new passion of mine, providing a great workout and an outlet for my competitive spirit.

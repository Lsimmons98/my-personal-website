        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
            Education has always been important to me. I graduated from Farmingdale State College in August 2022 with a degree in Business Management. Before that, I attended Riverhead High School in New York and graduated in 2016. Learning is something I've always enjoyed. Whether it was in customer development, sales, or delivery roles, I loved the process of picking up new skills. That's why I'm excited about codingâ€”it's a field where there's always something new to learn.
